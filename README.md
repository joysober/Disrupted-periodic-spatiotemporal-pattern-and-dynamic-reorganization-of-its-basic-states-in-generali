Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy

The fixed and individual-tailored periodic spatiotemporal patterns were detected by step08_02_fixed_PSTP_main.m and step08_01_individual_tailored_PSTP_main.m.

The example data can be found in "All_Preproc_Data", and the specific preprocessing steps can be found in the original text.
